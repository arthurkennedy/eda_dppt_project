    "\n",
    "While it is common to practice replace missing values with a resonable estimate like mean, median or mode of the column, dropping the missing values in this case was reasonable because of the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Missing Data Size__: The dataset contains only around 100 missing values, which is a small fraction compared to the total number of rows(~10,000). Specifically, this amounts to only about 1% of the total data which makes it a negligible loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Impact on Analysis__: Dropping a small number of rows is unlikely to affect the overall analysis significantly. The data after removal still provides enough info for reliable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Imputation trade offs__: Replacing missing vlaues with the mean or statistical estimates could introduce *bias* or distort the distribution of data, especially if the missing is not random. Since the number of missing values in relatively small, dropping them would have less potential to skew the results."

    "#### What Are Outliers?\n",
    "An outlier is a point or set of points of data that significantly differs from the rest of the data. These points can be:\n",
    "* Extremely high values\n",
    "* Extremely low values\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can distort statistical analyses and often lead to less accurate models. Therefore, detecting and removing them is usually a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Remove Outliers?\n",
    "Outliers can severely impact the performance of a model. They can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Skew results__ by disproportionately influencing statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.).\n",
    "* __Reduce model accuracy__ by leading algorithms to make inaccurate predictions or assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Outlier Detection with IQR\n",
    "For outlier detection, IQR (Interquartile Range) method is used. This is a common technique for identifying outliers by analyzing the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The IQR is calculated as the difference between the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles of the data.\n",
    "* Outliers are typically defined as points that fall below `Q1 - 1.5 * IQR` or above `Q3 + 1.5 * IQR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Visualizing Outliers\n",
    "Outliers are often easily identifiable through visualizations like box plots. Box plots display the spread and distribution of data, and any points that fall outside the \"box\" are considered potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the box plots for the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MSRP\n",
    "* Cylinders\n",
    "* Horsepower\n",
    "* EngineSize\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these plots, some points lies outside the box. These points represent the outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tutorial Source\n",
    "The outlier detection and removal method used assignment is based on a tutorial from Towards Data Science, which provides a detailed explanation of various techniques for handling outliers."

In this case, there are mainly 10 different types of car manufacturing companies, but it is often important to know who has the most number of cars. To do this histogram is one of the trivial solutions which lets us know the total number of car manufactured by a different company."
